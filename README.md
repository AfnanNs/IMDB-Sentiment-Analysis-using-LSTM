# IMDB-Sentiment-Analysis-using-LSTM

The goal of This project is to analyze customers' sentiment towards a product by performing sentiment analysis on user reviews from IMDB.<br>

Sentiment analysis is a widely used natural language processing (NLP) task that involves the classification of text into positive or negative based on the underlying sentiment
. To perform sentiment analysis, we will be using a recurrent neural network (RNN), a deep learning model that can analyze sequences of data, such as text.<br>
By training an RNN on a dataset of IMDB reviews labeled with their corresponding sentiment, we aim to develop a system that can accurately predict the sentiment of new, unseen reviews. <br>
The insights gained from this analysis can be used by businesses to understand customer feedback and improve their products and services.
